             <h4> <p>We are implementing Pair based authentication system in which at the time of registration
                the user has to provide all his details along with the password known as secret pass.
                The secret pass has to be not more than 8 digits long and should contain even no of characters.
                During login phase, the user has to enter his username and the session password. Session
                passwords are generated based on this secret pass. During the login phase, when the user enters
                his username an interface consisting of a grid is displayed. The grid is of size 6 x 6 and it
                consists of alphabets and numbers. These are randomly placed on the grid and the interface
                changes every time. User has to enter the password depending upon the secret pass. User has to 
                consider his secret pass in terms of pairs. The session password consists of alphabets and digits.
                The first letter in the pair is used to select the row and the second letter is used to select the column. 
                The intersection letter is part of the session password. This is repeated for all pairs of
                secret pass. The password entered by the user is verified by the server to authenticate the user. If the password is correct,
                the user is allowed to enter in to the system. The grid size can be increased to include special
                characters in the password.
